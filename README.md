omrails4
==

This is a pinterest style app based on the One Month Rails tutorial by Mattan Griffel - http://onemonthrails.com

It differs from the tutorial in the following ways (as of September 24, 2013)

- uses Rails 4 instead of Rails 3
- uses the high_voltage gem for static pages
- uses the figaro gem for setting ENV variables
